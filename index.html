        <div id=cuernocueva>DUMBY:

<br>I don’t think we are bad. I think we are all good, except Tuppy.

<br>LORD DARLINGTON:

<br>No, we are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.

<br>DUMBY:

<br>We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars? Upon my word, you are very romantic tonight, Darlington.

<br>CECIL GRAHAM:

<br>Too romantic! You must be in love. Who is the girl?</div>

        <div id=two>‘We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars’
          this oft-quoted line from Oscar Wilde was not spoken by Wilde during conversation,
          <br>as so many of his witty lines were.
          <br>Instead, ‘we are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars’
          <br>is uttered by one of Wilde’s characters in his play,
          <br>Lady Windermere’s Fan.
          <br>But what is the meaning of this pithy and strangely beautiful line?</div>

          <div id=three>And this early theatrical success
            <br>for Wilde has more than its fair share of quips,
            <br>many of which are still well-known:
            <br>‘I can resist everything except temptation’,
            <br>‘a man who knows the price of everything
            <br>and the value of nothing’
            <br>(a definition of a cynic),
            <br>and ‘experience is the name
            <br>everyone gives to their mistakes’
            <br>But the most famous is also the most romantic:
            <br>Lord Darlington’s
            <br>‘we are all in the gutter,
            <br>but some of us are looking at the stars.’</div>
